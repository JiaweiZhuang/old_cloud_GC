# Motivation

You'll get those advantages over traditional platforms:

* Run GEOS-Chem without buying local machines -- get a virtual Linux server on the cloud in seconds 
* No compilation error anymore -- all software and libraries are pre-installed
* 1-month 4x5 standard chemistry simulation costs $1~2 -- no charge when you are not running the model <br/> [(cost analysis)](Timing-and-Cost.md)
* Almost no limit on computational resources and storage -- pay for more whenever you need to
* Get access to more [earth science applications on the cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/earth/)
