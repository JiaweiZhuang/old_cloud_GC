#### That's the (oversimplified) idea of cloud computing:

1) Companies such as Amazon and Google set up a huge amount of computers that are distributed across the world. <br/>
No one actually knows how large their total computing power is,
but it is expected to be comparable to top supercomputers in the world.  

2) A user requests a certain amount of computational resources, including CPU, memory and disk space. 
Then, some of the computers are assigned to (i.e. temporarily belong to) that specific user. 

3) The most typical way to remotely control those machines is still through the command line Secure Shell (SSH), 
which is exactly the same as working with your local servers.
The only thing new in cloud computing is the way to request and control computational resources. 
How to actually run programs on them is not too different.
