Trying to set up GEOS-Chem on Amazon EC2 cloud computing platform

# === for the latest v11-02-Dev
$git clone https://bitbucket.org/gcst/gc_bleeding_edge.git
$git checkout Dev
$make MET=geos-fp GRID=4x5
It compiles smoothly

# === for the public-release v11-01
To compile with gfortran-6:
in Makefile_header.mk, change
ifeq ($(COMPILER),gfortran)
to
ifeq ($(COMPILER),gfortran-6)

But there's still some error
