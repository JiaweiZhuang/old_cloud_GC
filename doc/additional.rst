====================

The majority of cloud computing textbooks and AWS documentations are written 
for web developers and system architects, NOT for domain scientists 
who just want to do scientific computing and data analysis on the cloud.
As a domain scientist with limited IT background,
it is crucial the pick up the correct tutorial on cloud computing.
Here are my recommendations:

[1] **University of Washington** has a very nice 
`high-level overview <https://itconnect.uw.edu/research/
cloud-computing-for-research/cloud-computing-basics/>`_
and 
`technical documentation <https://cloudmaven.github.io/documentation/>`_
about cloud computing for scientific research.

[2] **Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering (Foster and Gannon 2017)** 
is the first textbook I am aware of that provides hands-on tutorials for domain scientists. 
The book is `free available online <https://cloud4scieng.org/chapters/>`_.

[3] **Cloud Computing in Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (Vance et al. 2016)** 
gives a nice overview of various cloud computing applications in our field.
It doesn't tell you how to actually do cloud computing, though.

[4] **Researcherâ€™s Handbook by AWS** is the most useful AWS material for you 
(as a scientist, not an IT person). You will need to sign-up the 
`AWS Research Cloud Program <https://aws.amazon.com/
government-education/research-and-technical-computing/research-cloud-program/>`_
to download the PDF file.
