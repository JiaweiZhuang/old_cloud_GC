GEOS-Chem on cloud computing platforms
======================================

`GEOSChem-on-cloud <http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/research.html#cloud>`_
project aims to build a cloud computing capability for GEOS-Chem_ that can be easily
accessed by researchers worldwide. 

See :ref:`motivation-label` and :ref:`new-opportunity-label` for why moving to the cloud. 
See :ref:`tutorial-label` to start your first GEOS-Chem simulation on the 
`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <https://aws.amazon.com/>`_ cloud within 10 mintues
(and within seconds for the next time).

This project is supported by the AWS Public Data Set Program and
the NASA Atmospheric Composition Modeling and Analysis Program (ACMAP).

.. warning::
  *GEOSChem-on-cloud* is at initial development and things are moving very fast.
  Please use the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/JiaweiZhuang/cloud_GC/issues>`_
  to request new funtionalities, report bugs, or just discuss general issues.
